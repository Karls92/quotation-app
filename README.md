# quotation-app
Quotation application built with Javascript Vanilla

This application allows you to create a quote based on a group of products or services previously added.

It is created with HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla javascript. It is a demonstration of the process to make a quote for products or services.

If you want to use the app, you must first add products or services in the product section and then you can create a quote by selecting the previously added products or services. 
As a practice, you can add other functionality to the application to allow user saving the quotes in a database or file destined to save the data.
